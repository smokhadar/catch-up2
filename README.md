## User_Story

AS A person that wants to stay in contact with friends and family,
I WANT to post content, and engage with others content,
SO THAT I can maintain relationships online.

## Description

This is a social media application where users can create an account, create a post, delete their own post, view all users’ post, and add comments on other user’s posts. We built this project using the MERN(MongoDb, Express, React, and Node.js) stack, a GraphQl API, user authentication with JWT, and Semantic UI to style our application.

## Usage

The link will take you to a login page. To use the app, you must register and create a username, then you are able to login.  Once logged in, you are taken to your homepage.  At the nav bar, you have tabs on the left for home, messaging and friend's list, on the right is a search for friends bar, and a logout button. On the main page you have your profile section on the left that lists your email, username, photo, friend's count and posts count.  There is a post section where you can enter whatever thoughts or message you want to share.  Below that is a feed of all the posts from other users.  Once you post, you are able to see all of your posts in the feed. Users are also able to like and comment on each posts.  On the right is a list of other users currently online.
