## User_Story

AS A person that wants to stay in contact with friends and family,
I WANT to post content, and engage with others content,
SO THAT I can maintain relationships online.

## Description

This is a social media application where users can create an account, create a post, delete their own post, view all users’ post, and add comments on other user’s posts. We built this project using the MERN(MongoDb, Express, React, and Node.js) stack, a GraphQl API, user authentication with JWT, and Semantic UI to style our application.
